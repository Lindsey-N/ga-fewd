<!-- NOTES FOR INSTRUCTORS! PLEASE READ!

 I attempted to find some code to move the the text a few pixels to the left so it'd look better, but all of them needed me to know like 50 other things beforehand like divs (I have no idea what those are yet.) But yes, everything needs to be moved a few dozen pixels to the left to line up correctly, but I will figure this out later. Unfortunatly, this problem persists on all pages. 

 There is also a horizontal tiling issue, which I'd like to fix, but am unsure how. (Maybe it's not an issue, but I don't want it to tile like it's doing) Stretch the background image somehow so the red line doesn't keep showing up?

 I  also realize that the text doesn't line up exactly with the background image of paper, but I liked the image, and didn't want to have to find a different one with better spacing, nor could I find anything on how to change the spacing of the current text to fit better 

 I am sure that you have many things that you'd like to comment on, but these are the issues that I had while coding, and I would be really appreciative if some answers or help could be had for these specific issues as well. An answer such as "we cover this later!" or saying you don't have enough time is perfectly fine, I understand you have to look at a lot of code. Thank you!-->
